# Bloatynosy Nue
You probably remember my classic BloatynosyApp, which had to go through some renaming and eventually got discontinued. Everything that came after, like the web-based "Winpilot," didn't last long either. Honestly, I thought I was done with Bloatynosy-well, at least with the name. But then, during a recent visit to a well-known company, I saw an employee Googling the app and trying to download it, and I had to stifle a laugh. Apparently, the legend lives on. The employee and I had a good laugh about it, and he even called it the epitome of debloating.

Sometimes, I think a little too long about things, and then a useful project just pops out. Bloatynosy was one of those projects. Sure, the name wasn't for everyone, but it was the go-to tool for cleaning up and debloating Windows. Recently, I added an OOBE assistant called "Fresh11" to the FlybyScript—basically, an all-in-one solution and I figured, why not use the same foundation to bring Bloatynosy back to life?

I had a hard time committing to it, but in the end, I went for it. Now I can proudly say that after Bloatynosy, there won’t be anything newer or better. This time, it'll be even leaner, more efficient, smaller, and faster. A simple .exe that anyone can understand, doing exactly what bugs us after installing Windows 11. The reborn Bloatynosy carries the "Nue" extension, not "New" ;) The last solid, classic version was 0.85, and that's where Im picking up (with a fresh new interface). The build carries a small 11.x version number.

Its primarily designed for Windows 11, but it can also be used on Windows 10, though not all settings are applicable there.

### Features:

- Native stuff (no web app crap)
- Back to basics: efficient and user-friendly
- No AI/Copilot integration
- Focused on the essentials

### What's next:
- Localizations coming soon for a global reach
  
And much more to come, stay tuned. Feel free to vote for or suggest new features, including those that were part of the classic Bloatynosy but are still missing

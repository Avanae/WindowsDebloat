  "PlugID": "Windows Rollback Timer",
  "PlugInfo": "This plugin checks and sets the uninstall window for reverting to a previous Windows version after an upgrade. The time frame can be configured up to 60 days. After a Windows upgrade (e.g., via Windows Update to version 1803), a copy of the previous Windows version is stored in the 'Windows.old' folder. This allows users to return to the prior version through the 'Recovery' option under 'Update & Security' in Windows Settings. By default, this rollback option is available for only 10 days, provided the 'Windows.old' folder hasnâ€™t been deleted. However, this time frame can be extended up to 60 days using this plugin. \n\n**Error Handling**: If 'Error 1168' appears when attempting to set the rollback period, this indicates that the 'Windows.old' folder has been deleted, making a rollback impossible.",

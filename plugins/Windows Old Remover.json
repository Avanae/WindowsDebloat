  "PlugInfo": "The Windows Old Remover plugin allows users to easily remove the 'Windows.old' folder, which contains files from a previous Windows installation. After upgrading to a new version of Windows, the 'Windows.old' folder may occupy significant disk space. This plugin utilizes the DISM command to safely delete this folder, freeing up valuable storage on your system. Please note that once this folder is deleted, you will no longer be able to revert to the previous Windows version through the Recovery options.\n\n**Error Handling**: If you encounter 'Error 1168' during the removal process, it means the 'Windows.old' folder has already been deleted or is not available for rollback. Ensure you have backups before proceeding!",
